String manipulation and substring problems are commonly asked in Java developer interviews to assess candidates' understanding of string handling, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving skills. Here's a list of some common string substring problems that Java developers may encounter during interviews:

1. **Find Substring in String**: Given a string and a substring, write a Java program to check if the substring exists in the string.

2. **Count Occurrences of a Substring**: Write a Java function to count the number of occurrences of a substring within a given string.

3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

4. **Reverse a String**: Implement a Java function to reverse a given string. You may also be asked to do this without using built-in string reversal functions.

5. **Anagram Detection**: Write a Java program to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other (i.e., they have the same characters in different orders).

6. **Palindrome Check**: Implement a Java function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

7. **String Compression**: Given a string, write a Java function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3."

8. **String Rotation**: Check if one string is a rotation of another. For instance, "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat."

9. **Substring with Concatenation of All Words**: Given a string and a list of words, find all starting indices of substring(s) in the given string that is a concatenation of all the words exactly once.

10. **Minimum Window Substring**: Given two strings, S, and T, find the minimum window in S that contains all characters from T.

11. **Valid Parentheses**: Determine if a given string containing parentheses is valid (i.e., all open parentheses are closed correctly).

12. **Implement strStr()**: Implement the `strStr()` function, which finds the first occurrence of a substring (needle) in a string (haystack).

13. **Group Anagrams**: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another.

14. **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

15. **Edit Distance**: Calculate the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another. These operations include insertion, deletion, and substitution of a character.

16. **Regular Expression Matching**: Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'. For example, "aa" matches "a*", "ab" matches ".*", etc.

17. **ZigZag Conversion**: Convert a given string to a zigzag pattern with a specified number of rows.

18. **String to Integer (atoi)**: Implement the `atoi` function that converts a string to an integer.

19. **Valid Palindrome II**: Given a non-empty string, you can delete at most one character to make it a palindrome. Determine whether you can do it.

20. **Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters**: Find the length of the longest substring with at most two distinct characters.

When preparing for Java developer interviews, it's essential to not only solve these problems but also understand the time and space complexity of your solutions. Practice coding these problems, discuss your approaches, and optimize them as much as possible to demonstrate your problem-solving skills effectively.
